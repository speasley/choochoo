# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 2 November 2023

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains that I do not collect any personal information or data when you use my software available in the Chrome Web Store. Your privacy is important to me, and I am committed to maintaining your anonymity and ensuring that your data remains secure. So much so that I do not even collect any. To me, it is not even there.

## 2. Information Collection

I do not collect any personal information, including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number, or any other data that can be used to identify you. See? Nothing.

## 3. Data Usage

Since I do not collect any personal information, there is no data that we can use or share with third parties. They will get only a blank envelope. Probably not even that.

## 4. Data Security

Although I do not collect any information, I still take reasonable measures to ensure the security of my software or website. All non-violent, of course.

## 5. Changes to this Privacy Policy

If there are any changes to this Privacy Policy, this document will be updated. Your continued use of my software or website implies your acceptance of these terms.
